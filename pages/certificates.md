## What are certificates and certificate authorities?

Websites use **certificates** to create an HTTPS connection. When signed by a trusted **certificate authority** (CA), certificates give confidence to browsers that they are visiting the "real" website.

Technically, a certificate is a file that contains:

* The domain(s) it is authorized to represent.
* A numeric "public key" that mathematically corresponds to a "private key" held by the website owner.
* A cryptographic signature by a certificate authority (CA) that vouches for the relationship between the private key and the authorized domain(s).
* Other technical information, such when the certificate expires, and how extensively the domain was validated.
* Optionally, information about a person or organization that owns the domain(s).

Web browsers are generally set to trust a pre-selected list of certificate authorities (CAs), and the browser can verify that any signature it sees comes from a CA in that list. The list of trusted CAs is set either by the underlying operating system or by the browser itself.

When a website presents a certificate to a browser during an HTTPS connection, the browser uses the information and signature in the certificate to confirm that a CA it trusts has decided to trust the website the browser is connecting to.

## What kind of rules and oversight are certificate authorities subject to?

Since 2012, all major browsers and certificate authorities participate in the **[CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org). Though self-regulated, the CA/Browser Forum is effectively the governing body for publicly trusted certificate authorities.

The CA/B Forum produces the **[Baseline Requirements](https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/)** (BRs), a set of technical and procedural policies that all CAs must adhere to. These policies are determined through a [formal voting process](https://cabforum.org/ballots/) of browsers and CAs. The BRs are enforced through a combination of technical measures, a system of standard third-party audits, and the overall community's attention to publicly visible certificates.

The Baseline Requirements only constrain CAs -- they do not constrain browser behavior. Since browser vendors ultimately decide which certificates their browser will trust, they are the enforcers and adjudicators of BR violations. If a CA is found to be in violation of the BRs, a browser may punish that CA's ability to issue certificates that that browser will trust, up to and including expulsion from that browser's trust store.

## Does the US government operate a publicly trusted certificate authority?

No, not as of late 2015, and this is unlikely to change in the near future.

The [Federal PKI](http://www.idmanagement.gov/federal-public-key-infrastructure) root is trusted by some browsers and operating systems, but is not contained in the [Mozilla Trusted Root Program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/).
s
The Federal PKI has an [open application](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478418) to the Mozilla Trusted Root Program. However, even if the Federal PKI's application is accepted, it will take a significant amount of time for the Federal PKI's root certificate to propagate widely around the world.

## Are there federal restrictions on acceptable certificate authorities to use?

There are no government-wide rules limiting what CAs federal domains can use.

It is important to understand that, while there may be technical or business reasons for an agency to limit which CAs it uses, **there is no security benefit** to limiting CAs through internal policies alone. Browsers will trust certificates acquired from any publicly trusted CA, and so limiting CA usage internally will not limit the CAs from which an attacker may obtain a forged certificate.

In practice, federal agencies use a wide variety of publicly trusted commercial CAs and privately trusted enterprise CAs to secure their web services.

## Then how can I limit which CAs can issue certificates for a domain?

There is no simple and 100% effective way to force all browsers to only trust certificates for your domain that have been issued from a certain CA. In general, the strength of HTTPS on today's internet depends on the overall standards, competence, and accountability of the entire CA system.

However, domain owners have some options to reduce the risk or impact of misissued or fraudulent certificates:

### Certificate Transparency

**[Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency)** (CT) allows domain owners to **detect missuance of certificates after the fact**.

CT that allows CAs to publish some or all of the publicly trusted certificates that they issue to one or more public logs. Multiple organizations run CT logs, and it is possible to automatically monitor the logs for any certificates that are issued for any domains of interest.

Comodo has released an [open source](https://github.com/crtsh) Certificate Transparency log viewer that they operate at [crt.sh](https://crt.sh). For example, it is possible to see [all recent certificates for whitehouse.gov](https://crt.sh/?q=whitehouse.gov), and [details of specific certificates](https://crt.sh/?id=7976268).

The strength of Certificate Transparency increases as more CAs publish more certificates to public CT logs. Certificate Transparency is not currently a requirement for CAs -- however, as the use of CT increases, so does the viability of requiring CT for publicly issued certificates.

### HTTP Public Key Pinning

**[HTTP Public Key Pinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning)** (HPKP) allows domain owners to **tell browsers which certain keys, certs or CAs are trusted for their domain**.

Domain owners can [use HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning) in one of two ways:

* The `Public-Key-Pins` header contains a list of SHA-256 hashes of public key information corresponding to client, intermediate, or root certificates. [Supporting browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=hpkp) will hard-fail on certificates whose validated chain does not contain at least one of the listed keys. The domain owner can list a URI that browsers can POST to with error information when a hard-fail occurs.

* The `Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only` HTTP header contains the same information, but will not fail or show users an error if a pinning violation is detected. Browsers will report detected violations to a given URI. This is

Using `Public-Key-Pins` is **potentially dangerous**, and mistakes can lead to a site being rendered entirely inaccessible for weeks or months.

Using `Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only` is very safe, and can provide useful information to detect potential certificate misissuance or attacks on users.

Like [HSTS](/hsts/), HPKP only takes effect once the browser has visited the site once and received the HPKP header over a secure connection. HPKP preloading is possible, but as of 2015 this requires special manual coordination with browsers to do.
